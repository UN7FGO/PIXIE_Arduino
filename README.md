# PIXIE_Arduino
Various VFO in Arduino for PIXIE transceiver

Here I post my attempts to make an additional VFO for the pixie transceiver.

Projects implemented on Arduino and AD9850 synthesizer.

The latest version with support for the LCD screen and the control of PDF on three bands.

This project is educational in nature and does not claim to be ideal in terms of electronics.

Suggestions and criticism are welcome.
